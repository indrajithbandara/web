This is the XMPP instant messenger client I created as part of my undergraduate final year project. It uses the Smack library for communicating with XMPP servers. It supports text formatting, emoticons, file transfer, and audio streaming.

To compile the application just type ant. This should create a dist directory containing the XMPP_Client.jar file. It should also copy the lib directory to the dist folder as these are required runtime libraries.
